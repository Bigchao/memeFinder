Create a bot that parses Twitter pages and Telegram channels of famous Solana KOLs and searches for promising memecoins tickers. Make sure to include these accounts:
https://x.com/CryptoNobler
https://x.com/Danny_Crypton
https://x.com/DefiWimar
 
Adjust the code so it finds these tickers on https://pump.fun/board and https://dexscreener.com/ using the contract addresses mentioned in KOLs' tweets.
 
Adjust the code so it analyzes the project's twitter page via https://x.com/TweetScout_io
Check the overall score, known followers and the trust level.
 
Adjust the code so it checks the contract score via solsniffer.com and skip the coin if the score is lower than 85
 
Create buy and sell modules for coin on Solana, set priority fees, buy amount to 1 SOL, buy & sell slippage to 15% and take profit levels at 10x leaving a moonbag of 15%.
 
Merge every code snippet you send above to a single file and fix all the errors. Create a step-by-step guide on how to run the code.
